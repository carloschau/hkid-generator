# [HKID Number Generator](https://carloschau.github.io/hkid-generator/)

This web page is a recreation of Ice Lam's [Hong Kong Identity Card Number Generator and Validator](https://github.com/icelam/hkid-generator) using React.js and Material UI, but only contains the HKID generator.

An ehnacement has also been made to allow generating multiple HKID numbers at once. The format of generated HKID numbers is also changed to put the check digit in blackets to fit my own use.
